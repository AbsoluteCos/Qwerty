/*Exercise 3 - learning to make for loops, while loops and if statements. 
 * Objective - be able to decide which loop to use and use it correctly.
 * Make loops that do certain tasks.

public class Loops {
	int i = 94;
//write a main method.
//after writing main method, write a for loop that counts from 0 to 100 and prints out each number. Make a while loop that runs as long as i > 57.
//Then, write an if statement to check if the variable used in the for loop is equal to i. If it is, the print success. 
//Then create an else if to check if i > the for loop variable. If it is, print greater than.
//After the else if, make an else statement that prints fail.

/*Extension - 
Knowing what you have learned so far, make a new class named LoopsPlus that does something unexpected and spectacular. Use for and while loops. 
Extra - you can have nested loops, which is when there is a loop inside a loop. Try this out and see how it goes.
