        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <p>
            Variables in JavaScript can store any single value you want, but what if you want to store multiple values?
            For that, we use arrays, like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>const myArray = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]</code></pre>

        <p>
            If we now want to access the contents of the array, we can do this:
        </p>
        
        <pre><code>myArray[0]</code></pre>

        <p>
            This will give us <code>"foo"</code>.
            Note that because element 0 of the array is the first one, element 1 will be the second one, and so on.
            This is counterintuitive, so be careful when accessing elements of arrays.
