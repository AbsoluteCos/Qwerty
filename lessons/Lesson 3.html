<h1>Lesson 3</h1>
<p>
Now lets talk about for loops, whiile loops, and if statements. for loops are called definite loops because they have a
defined length. While loops on the other hand do not have a defined length. if statements are not a loop and only run once.
for loops take three values, a starting int, condition, and action in the contructor.
For example: for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++){Code...} This for loop will execute as long as the value of 1 is less than 6.
The first part is making an int to increment. The second part is the condition which must be true in order to do what
is inside the for loop. The last part is the incrementer. In this example, the for loop will execute 6 times, when i is
0,1,2,3,4,5, and 6. While loops on the other hand do not have any specified length. The most common use for a while loop
is when the length of the loop is unknown. The syntax looks like : while(true){Code../.} This while loop is a while true
which means it never stops. This while loop can be exited by saying break; at any point inside the loop.
The while loop only takes one constructor which is a condition which must be met in order to
execute the code inside the while loop. For example while(i > 4){Code.... i--} In this example, i is initialized outside and
is being incremented by minus 1 each time. So, the while loop will execute as long as i > 4.Lastly, an if statement checks
for true or false. If it is true, the code inside will be executed, if it is not, it will skip the code inside the if statement
and move on. The syntax for an if statement looks like: if(i < 10){Code....} If statements take a variety of conditions such as
equal to, less than, not equal to etc. Equal to is == for numbers and .equals("example") for comparing Strings. In order to say
not equal to, just put an != instead of ==. In most cases an ! means negative. if statements also have extension statements such
as else if and else. else if also checks for true or false and functions the same way as a regular if statement. But, an else
if will only be checked if the if statement before is false. If the preceeding if statement is true, the computer will skip the
else if. The syntax for else if looks like: else if(i > 15){Code....} Lastly, else statements take no arguments. The else will
always execute if the preceeding if statement is false. If the precedding if statement is true, the else will be skipped.
The syntax looks like: else{Code...}

Now it is your turn. Using what you have learned so far, create a class called increment that has a main method, a for loop
that prints integers between 45 and 56. A while loop that runs 8 times and print your name each time. And lastly, make an
if statement that checks if a previously created int is equal to 10.
