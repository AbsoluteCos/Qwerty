<h1>Arrays</h1>
<p>
    Variables in JavaScript can store any single value you want, but what if you want to store multiple values?
    For that, we use arrays, like this:
</p>
<pre><code>const myArray = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]</code></pre>

<p>
    If we now want to access the contents of the array, we can do this:
</p>

<pre><code>myArray[0]</code></pre>

<p>
    This will give us <code>"foo"</code>.
    Note that because element 0 of the array is the first one, element 1 will be the second one, and so on.
    This is counterintuitive, so be careful when accessing elements of arrays.
</p>

<p>
    All arrays have a set of methods you can use to modify the array using the dot selector (.), one of which includes the .length() function.
    This function, as you probably can tell, returns how many elements are in the array.
