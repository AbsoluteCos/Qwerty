<h1>Classes</h1>
<p>
Now that you have learned about data types and printing, lets talk about classes. Every Java program must have a class.
  A class always has a header. The header looks like: public class SampleClass{Code......}. Each class must also have a main
 method. In the main method is where all the code is paced and is executed. Without a main method, the code will not run.
  Other than a main method, you can also have specific methods than can do certain things based on the input. We will discuss
 such methods in the later lessons. The main method always looks like: public static void main (String [] args){Code...}.

Now it is your turn. Make a class with any name. The class must have a main method. Make the class do something that is
 unexpected and spectacular.
