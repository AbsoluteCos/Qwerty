<h1>Lesson 1</h1>
<p>
First let's start with some basics. Java has many data types, but we will be focusing on Strings,
 ints, doubles, chars, and booleans.
  Strings are words and are enclosed by "". Strings can hold anything
 you want them to from basic words to complicated math algorithms, and will be enclosed in double quotes (""). String will not evaluate anything
 inside them. For example: "1+2" will be saved as 1+2 not 3.
  Ints are integers and can hold values between -2147483648 and 2147483647 which makes them large enough to
 store our basic data.
  Doubles are decimals and always equates to one decimal point unless specified otherwise. Doubles can
 hold values between ±4.9E-324 and ±1.7976931348623157E+308. Thus, making a double large enough for our
 basic data.
  Chars are characters and are enclosed by single quotes (''). Chars can only hold one character. For example: a char can
 hold "a" but cannot hold "and".
  Booleans can either hold the values true or false.

Now it is your turn. Write a new program with a String, int, and a double. Print the String followed by the sum of the int
 and the decimal. Hint: by placing a + after a variable, you can add more things to your print statement. For example:
 System.out.println("Hello, answer to 2 + 3 is " + (2+3)); will print Hello, answer to 2 + 3 is 5. Learning print
 statements is very useful in real life applications in java to print output for given inputs and to debug.
